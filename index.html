    <p>I started painting in Photoshop a few years ago to visualize ideas that I had for game projects.<br>

    <p class="text2">Created in Unity 3D</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>During my first semester at Georgia Tech, I joined the campus video game development club, <br><a href="http://vgdev.gtorg.gatech.edu/">VGDev</a>,
    where 6 to 7 student-led teams complete a small game each semester. The project I<br>
    became a part of, Space Squids, is a fast-paced 2-player racing game akin to Mario Kart.<br><br>
    Except in space. With squids.<br><br>
    Apart from various programming and audio contributions, I was responsible for creating the first<br>
    of the game's three levels (which I play in the video), including its constituent models, shaders,<br>
    and textures. I also worked with the rest of the team to establish a consistent artstyle that was<br>
    both visually appealing and cost-efficient, as 60fps performance is paramount in a racing game.<br>
    You can download the complete Blender file of my level <a href="content/Sean Flanagan - Example Model.blend">here</a>.<br><br>
    The game was a big hit at the club's end-of-semester expo - people had a ton of fun playing it.</p></td>

    <p class="text2">Created in GameMaker: Studio</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>I created this lovingly-titled game prototype over the course of four months<br />
      during my junior year of high school. It's a 1-to-4-player physics &quot;platformer&quot;<br />
      where everyone plays as a softbody blob. Hilarity tends to ensue in groups.</p>
    <p>As the single person working on this project, I created all the art and sound assets, and<br />
    also programmed an engine within Game Maker which allowed me to build levels with more organic, line-segment-based geometry (instead of the more typical grid/tile-based paradigm.)<br />
      My implementation was inspired by Ubisoft's UbiART engine (Rayman Origins, Valiant Hearts)<br />
      which works in much the same way. More natural design does wonders for 2D game art.</p>
    <p>I entered this game into the 2014 Georgia Educational Technology Fair<br />
and won first place in the state for 11th/12th-grade Game Design.</p></td>
